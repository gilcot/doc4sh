This a collection of scripts that could be a Ghist each.

## `get_comments`

During my _Unix_ course, this is one of the exercice I ask my students in
in order to start playing with `grep`: 
1. "Write a script that will extract comment from a shell script. But make 
it fail when the script is called with no argument, and also when the script
file cannot be found or read, or doesn't contain shebang. Try to use only
grep and keep your script the smallest possible."
2. "Same script, but display some error message, when possible, with the
parameter expansion. Also change the check to allow any good name from 
/usr/ and /usr/local. Then, the script can work with: PERL, PHP, Python,
Ruby, Tcl, etc."

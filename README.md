# doc4sh

This a collection of scripts that could be a Ghist each.

## `get_comments`

During my _Unix_ course, this is one of the exercice I ask my students in
in order to start playing with `grep`: 
"Using only grep, write a script that will extract from a given shell script,
after checking the file argument, all comments that start at firsh column."

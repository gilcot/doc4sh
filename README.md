This a collection of scripts that could be a Ghist each.

## `get_comments`

During my _Unix_ course, this is one of the exercice I ask my students in
in order to start playing with `grep`: 
"Write a script that will extract comment from a shell script. But make it
fail when the script is called with no argument, and also when the script
file cannot be found or read. Try to use only grep and keep your script the
smallest possible."
